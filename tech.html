						<h2>Tech Demos</h2>
						<p>
							Some examples of technical demonstrations I've created. All made as solo course assessment projects, these were each
							used to learn a new concept in a custom environment, before applying
							the concept in a more advanced manner using the Unity engine.

						<h3>OpenGL Graphics Renderer</h3>
						<p>
							This project was created as part of an assessment to create a basic custom graphics engine using OpenGL.
							<br>
							It uses a projection matrix camera, with first-person flying controls, which can be used to inspect a spinning mesh with coloured light sources,
							detailed with albedo, normal and specular maps.
							While my implementation isn't a comprehensive game engine by any means, it gave me a fundamental understanding about aspects of the graphics pipeline and custom shaders,
							as well as technical aspects of how 3D assets work, and asset management.
							<br>
							Developing this lead into the more advanced application of shaders using Shader Graph, as seen below.

						<h3>Unity Shaders and Animation Project</h3>
						<p>
							<p>
							This project was an experimentation with ShaderGraph functionality built into the Unity engine, as well as Animation blend trees,
							and how the two integrate with a C# Unity codebase.
							<br>
							It contains a set of shaders I created to alter the appearance of a 3D animated character, and the ability to select different
							animations with callbacks - such as a sit-ups animation with a UI counter.
							<br>
							This project gave me familiarity with more technical aspects of the Unity engine that I hadn't interacted with prior.

						<h3>2D Rigid Body Physics Demonstration</h3>
						<p>
							<p>
							This project was created as an exercise in basic physics and collision detection with different shapes.
							You are able to place static and dynamic squares, circles or planes and marvel at the the way in which shapes avoid being inside one another.
							<br>
							The experience of physics simulations in a 2D environment utilized in this project was the inspiration for me to experiment further with 3D physics in the following project.

						<h3>Rope Simulation with Verlet Integration</h3>
						<p>
							<p>
							My goal for this project was to create a physically accurate rope/cable, and was inspired by rope physics in recent Naughty Dog games.
							<br>
							In addition to the rope system itself, I created a basic playground environment to be able to attach and detach ends of a rope to static or dynamic rigid bodies,
							in order to demonstrate how physical bodies affect the rope, and how its tension affects them back. This was sufficient, but with the surprising ease in which
							verlet integration solved basic rope simulation, I experimented with adding additional features, which have enabled me to use the system in other projects,
							particularly visual flair.
							<br><br>
							<b>Taking it further</b><br>
							Integrating breakable ropes felt like the logical next step to me, as the rope was already being simulated via nodes 'strung' together.
							I integrated a system to manually cut ropes, or cause them to break (in roughly the middle, or the spot most under tension) when
							the differentation between nodes exceeds a threshold.
							<br>
							In addition, as I wanted to use this asset for visual flair in other projects, I integrated a smoothing algorithm to be able to simulate ropes using very
							few nodes, whilst keeping the appearance high fidelity. I also implemented real-time mesh generation for cases where using using a textured line with billboarding
							is insufficient.
							<br><br>
							I'm still working on this project, and intend to add more features to make it viable to be used as more than visual flair in future games.
